The Odin Project Calculator

A basic but fully fledged calculator using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. This project belongs to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/calculator) curriculum, as the final project in the Foundations section.

## Things I've learned during this project:

- how to manipulate and access arrays in different use case scenarios
- using .reduce to access elements in array (although I ended up not using it as found a simpler way - I have left the commented out .reduce code to the scripts.js)
- debugging practices - the calculator produced many, many bugs
- how useful it is to create small subfunctions, that can be reused in several places
- how to make code more simple with use  of arrow functions and switch statements
- reinforcing my basic toolbox of different ways to approaching problems
- using pen and paper (or in my case, [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to create a UI mockup)

## Things I'm not happy about or will return to

- the code is in parts untidy and hard to read, especially selectOperator() is way too complex - I might come back to redo that part later
- large numbers (in the billions) crash the calculator
