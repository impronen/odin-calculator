The Odin Project Calculator

A basic but fully fledged calculator using HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. This project belongs to The Odin Project curriculum, as the final project in the Foundations section.

Things I've learned during this project:

- how to manipulate and access arrays in different use case scenarios
- debugging practices
- using .reduce to access elements in array (although I ended up not using it as found a simpler way)
- how to divide code to subfuntions
- how to make code more simple with use  of arrow functions and switch statements
